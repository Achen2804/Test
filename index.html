      For my culminating research topic, I chose to focus on the actions presidential candidate Andrew Yang has taken in 2020 to help people who have lost jobs due to automation. To my knowledge, Andrew Yang is a businessman, entrepreneur, lawyer and philanthropist, he started a company called venture for America to help create new jobs in poor areas but soon realized that people were losing far more jobs than he could create and decided that the best way to help these people was to implement a Universal Basic Income. So he ran for president In the past few months, interest in both Andrew Yang and UBI has increased drastically but he still has a long way to go before he can become the president. I chose to cover this topic because I feel that the automation of low skill jobs will be one of the greatest economic challenges of our time. Furthermore, upon listening to Yang talk about his campaign, what he has done and what he plans to do, I feel that Yang is the kind of person who plans to do a lot of work and as such will have a lot to talk about. Andrew Yang has deepened my understanding of how impactful automation will be in America. My end goal with this project is to better understand what Andrew Yang plans to do to fix this issue and become president.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Yang doesn’t qualify for the January debates </h2>
    <p class="body Introduction" >
      <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1181317800/960x0.jpg?fit=scale" class="center">For my first article I plan to analyze. I have chosen an article focused on one of the first major events to happen to Yang in 2020. This is his absence from the January Democratic debates. I see this as a major event for Yang as it is the first arguably his biggest setback since he started his campaign and is going to greatly hurt Yang as he needs to build himself a reputation.
    </p>
    <br>
     <p class="body"> For the topic, I decided to look at an article published by ABC news, the news division of the American Broadcasting Company, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/undaunted-missing-tuesdays-debate-andrew-yangs-absence-creates/story?id=68257838"> the article in question covers Yangs absence from the January debates</a>,, what that might mean for his campaign and how the yanggang reacted. It talks also about how this could greatly hurt peoples confidence in Yang as up until now he was seen as almost untouchable.</p>
     <p class="body">ABC news is the news division of the American Broadcasting Company, this means that the site is used to talk about news in general, as it doesn't specialize in covering politics I think that this does hurt its credibility somewhat. According to both mediabiasfactcheck and allsides, ABC news is a center left media source meaning that it oftenly will utilise loaded words in favour of liberal causes but is generally a trustworthy source. A 2014 Pew Research Survey found that 37% of ABC News’ audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 41% Mixed and 21% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that ABC is preferred by a more liberal audience. ABC news has not failed any fact checks made by an IFCN fact checker so it is factually accurate in its work. Therefore, I believe this source is a good one for me to use for this topic, as it has a high factual rating, and is only occasionally biased. This article was published on January 14, 2020, and so it is very relevant to Yang's current goal of putting money in the hands of American people through UBI since he plans to become president and this is about the primaries. ABC news' article is mostly fact based and does not include the opinions of the author. Instead, it takes the opinions of Yang and other people by quoting them. One issue that I hold with this article is that there are certain places where citation would have been greatly appreciated such as the part where it talks about sexual assault allegations against his staffers. The article does a fairly good job of delivering the story of Yang in an unbiased way. This is proven by the way it quotes different people and in general doesn't really have much of an overarching narrative about Yang.</p>
     <p class="body">Lastly, reading this article, there were two things I found to be a bit surprising, the sexual harassment allegations against his staffers and Yang claiming that the DNC was lacked rationality and flexibility. I decided to do a bit of research into these claims and from what I could tell it isn't exactly accurate. The article uses staffers as plural when it was one allegation against one staffer <b>and</b> the fact that Yang says he had looked into the allegation and found that the staffer didn't do anything sexual in nature. The part where Yang had slammed the DNC wasn't so much that they wouldn't let him on the debate stage as much as it was that they didn't run more polls. In conclusion, I think that most of what is said in the article is true as I have followed Yang for some time now and have seen some of these things happen myself, but there are some parts that are not entirely true.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Yang qualifies for February debate</h2>
    <p class="body Introduction">
        <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/1f01bb34381c4d0b9968940b9c809034/800.jpeg" class="center">
      For my second article, I decided to cover his qualification to the February primary debates. I've chosen to cover this as it is a great response to the first article which talked about how Yang might not be as untouchable as he seemed and this one showed that he is still capable of winning despite how long of a shot it may be.</p>
    <br>
  <p class="body"><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/26/politics/andrew-yang-qualifies-february-debate/index.html">The article in question </a>discusses his qualification to the New Hampshire debate in February. It talks about how he had already met the donor requirements and met the polling minimum after receiving 5% in a CNN poll of New Hampshire and 7% in a Washington Post and ABC national poll and thus qualifies for the debate making him the 7th person on the stage.</p>
  <p class="body">CNN is known to have a center left political bias, so I tried my best to look for possible examples of liberal bias while reading this article. However, I did not find any cases of bias as it didn't really try to paint a narrative nearly as much as it did just say what was going on. This could be because there is a lack of any form of talk about Yang or what this event means for him and his campaign. Unfortunately, CNN is known to have a mixed factual accuracy score so that hurts it's credibility but after looking into the matter a bit further and finding other sources on it. I found that this time around CNN was in fact correct(kind of hard to mess up something like this although).
</p>
  <p class="body">Personally, I think that this is a very big win for Andrew Yang because if he plans to make changes in the country, he needs people to hear his ideas and know who he is. The chances of him winning the election is very low but I think if he is able to make a name for himself and get enough attention he could set himself up for the next election or get himself on the cabinet of Bernie or Biden if they win. We do see that since Yang has started running, interest in UBI has increased greatly, the more chances he gets to talk, the more people seem to be interested.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Andrew Yang drops out of race</h2>
    <p class="body Introduction">For my third article, I have decided to cover Andrew Yang suspending his campaign. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the most important moments for Andrew Yang this entire year as it means that his chances of becoming the president or of spreading his ideas will greatly diminish.</p>
    <br>

    I think this article might be biased towards Yang. Although the article has mostly correct information, it decided to primarily focus on how well Yang did compared to other politicians by saying things such as "his rise from nowhere to outlasting sitting senators and governors to sixth in the polls was one of the biggest surprises of the Democratic primary" and how they tried to describe him in a way that would make him stand out like "Yang, with his non-politician speaking style and quirky sense of humor, drew a surprising following and online army of donors." I do think that most of what is being said about Yang is true as I've seen it myself over the past few months but I do believe that the writer of the article is not being entirely objective as he did not decide to mention some of his shortcomings such as how he never really was a high polling candidate. The author even suggests that Yang was when he said "He qualified for debates but started off relegated to the far edge of the stage where lower-polling candidates are placed.", the words started off suggest that Yang grew out of that location when the truth is that he was always in that spot. Other than that I think the news source is ok because it has a high factual accuracy rating according to mediabiasfactcheck.</p>
     <p class="body">This is a massive turning point in Yang's story, now that he's out of the race it's hard to imagine that the media will pay much attention to him.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Yang starts movement Humanity Forward.</h2>
    <p class="body Introduction">For my fourth article analysis, I was originally planning to discuss one of 3 topics:</p><ol class="body Introduction">
      <li>Yang getting a job at CNN
      <li>Yang endorsing Biden
      <li>Yang working with the Trump officials to about a plan for government stimulus checks
      </ol> 
      <p class="body Introduction">However, recently there was something else that has caught my attention.</p>
    <br>
     <p class="body"> An article was published on March 5th 2020 by CNBC titled<a href="">Andrew Yang’s new non-profit is giving away $500,000 in free cash as a UBI experiment. </a>CNBC is a center left news source with a high factual accuracy rating. However, the news source has been known to sometimes use loaded headlines such as “Trump resumes attack on the Fed as markets sink again.” The article in question discusses the start of a new organization called <a href="https://movehumanityforward.com">"Humanity Forward"</a> which according to the article is an organization made to help further his push for UBI by "demonstrate the efficacy of Yang’s political proposals in real life, funding candidates who support a UBI program and activating what Yang calls “politically disengaged” voters". It then goes on to talk about other things that Yang is doing such as his podcast and a lack of details from Yang about how he will get the $500,000.</p>
     <p class="body"> This article is mostly based on facts with little to no personal opinion from what I could tell. However, I would say that the claim that he did not specify on how he will get the funds isn't entirely fair as it calls into doubt if he can raise that money without considering his strong grassroots support. In the fourth quarter of the election cycle alone he raised over 16.5 million dollars according to the New York Time.</p>
     <p class="body">Reading this article has only further cemented my support for Yang as this move as it shows that he is willing to do more than just run for president to make his goals come true. If I had to guess, this is not the last time we will see Yang this year. I'm very curious how the Coronavirus will impact people's perception of the Freedom Dividend as this event will probably cause many people to lose their jobs in a manner not too different from automation.

    <h2 class="heading">Andrew Yang sues over New York’s shutdown of presidential primary</h2>
    <p class="body Introduction"></p>
    <br>
     <p class="body">The last article that I want to analyze is a recent one published on<a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/opinion/commentary/andrew-yang-risks-new-york-lives-symbolic-primary.html"> MAY 7th, 2020 by Ben Alder from City&State NewYork.</a> I have decided to use this article not because it is a great one, but because it is both so biased that it's pretty much just low hanging fruit and looking back on this piece almost a month later makes it pretty funny.</p>
     <p class="body">For some context to those who do not know, Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the race. Now Joe Biden is the only candidate still in the race. As a result of this and the covid pandemic, New York has pretty much canceled the Democratic presidential primary there by removing all candidates who have suspended their campaign from the ballot and cancelling the primary. The article itself is about how Yang sued arguing that this would be denying people's right to vote.</p>
     <p class="body">   <img src="https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/9531588142013/2020/1/61f993ecb7330672612a994110584fdb/Andrew-Yang-sues-New-York-over-canceled-presidential-primary.jpg" class="center">Let us begin with the biases of this article. First off, the name and picture they use are made to make Yang's actions seem careless and not very well thought out. Second of all, the article also tries to lump Yang and Trump into the same crowd with their lack of political experience as if the two of them could be compared in other ways as well. The article then goes on to call Yang's platform idiosyncratic without any further explanation or link as to why. In the very next paragraph, the writer once again goes on to talk about Trump only to shoehorn in Yang at the very end. Thereafter, the article goes on to talk about the details of the lawsuit and what is going on with it. Most of what is said here is without much bias from what I can tell. It talks about the potential dangers of opening for a mostly ceremonial primary during a pandemic. But then it goes back to being pretty unfaithful and dishonest by saying that not holding a primary is exactly what the republicans are doing because they too only have one candidate on the ballot. This however is not an apples to apples comparison as the reason why Trump is the only Repubican is because he was the only one that qualified. This is not the same for the Democrats as many Democrats did qualify only to be taken off after a rule was changed by the DNC in February that candidates who dropped out could not be on the ballot.
</p>
     <p class="body">But this article is in the past and the ruling has been made, it feels kind of humourous looking at this article now given the fact that Yang has won. It feels so strange watching most of the articles assertions about Yang pretty much get proven pointless or false. Yang lacked experience in politics yet the 3 judges from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to agree with him over those said "experienced statesmen and women". In fact it was such a clear cut that the judges concluded by saying that <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/its-official-new-yorks-presidential-primary-happening">“We have reviewed all of the remaining arguments raised by Defendants on appeal and find them to be without merit.”</a>  </p>

    <br>
     <p class="body">It's been a few months since I'd started my blog about Yang and what he has done. There are many things I wanted to cover but simply didn't have the space to talk about as I am only supposed to do 5 articles. Over this time, I have been able to learn a lot about Yang's situation, who he is as a person, and what he is willing to do. When I first started this blog I only had an idea about where Yang was from and what his policies are. I can now say with confidence that I am confident that Yang will be active all the way until the next election cycle. In the beginning, I thought I would cover people who endorsed Yang or some things that Yang said on the debate stage. As it turns out those would be small peanuts compared to what I really covered. </p>
